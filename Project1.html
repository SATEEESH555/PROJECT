    <h1>Backtracking</h1><br><br>
    <p>Backtracking is a form of recursion. <br><br>The usual scenario is that you are faced with a number of options, and you must choose one of these. After you make your<br> choice you will get a new set of options; just what set of options you get depends on what choice you made. This procedure is <br>repeated over and over until you reach a final state. If you made a good sequence of choices, your final state is a goal state; if <br>you didn't, it isn't.<br><br> Conceptually, you start at the root of a tree; the tree probably has some good leaves and some bad leaves, though it may be that <br>the leaves are all good or all bad. You want to get to a good leaf. At each node, beginning with the root, you choose one of its <br>children to move to, and you keep this up until you get to a leaf.<br><br> Suppose you get to a bad leaf. You can backtrack to continue the search for a good leaf by revoking your most recent choice,<br> and trying out the next option in that set of options. If you run out of options, revoke the choice that got you here, and try <br>another choice at that node. If you end up at the root with no options left, there are no good leaves to be found.</p>
    <br><br>
    <p>This needs an example.</p><br><br>
    <img src="./Image_root.jpg"><br><br>
    <p>1. Starting at Root, your options are A and B. You choose A.</p><br><br>
    <p>2. At A, your options are C and D. You choose C.</p><br><br>
    <p>3. C is bad. Go back to A.</p><br><br>
    <p>4. At A, you have already tried C, and it failed. Try D.</p><br><br>
    <p>5. D is bad. Go back to A.</p><br><br>
    <p>6. At A, you have no options left to try. Go back to Root.</p><br><br>
    <p>7. At Root, you have already tried A. Try B.</p><br><br>
    <p>8. At B, your options are E and F. Try E.</p><br><br>
    <p>9. E is good Congratulations.</p><br><br>

        <p>In this example we drew a picture of a tree. The tree is an abstract model of the possible sequences of choices we could<br> make. There is also a data structure called a tree, but usually we don't have a data structure to tell us what choices we <br>have. (If we do have an actual tree data structure, backtracking on it is called depth-first tree searching.)</p>

    <h2>The backtracking algorithm.</h2><br><br>
    <table border="1px solid"><pre style="color: #007eb4;">
        boolean solve(Node n) { <br>  if n is a leaf node { <br>    if the leaf is a goal node, return true <br>    else return false <br>  } else { <br>    for each child c of n {<br>      if solve(c) succeeds, return true <br>    }<br>   return false <br>  } <br>}
    </pre></table><br><br><br>
    <div style="height: 86px; width: 1032px; background-color:lightgray;">
        Notice that the algorithm is expressed as a boolean function. This is essential to understanding the algorithm. If <br>solve(n) is true, that means node n is part of a solution--that is, node n is one of the nodes on a path from the root to <br>some goal node. We say that n is solvable. If solve(n) is false, then there is no path that includes n to any goal node.
    </div><br><br>
    <h1>How does this work?</h1><br><br>
    <ul >
        <li>If any child of n is solvable, then n is solvable.</li>
        <li>If no child of n is solvable, then n is not solvable.</li>
    </ul><br><br>
    <pre style="color: #007eb4;">
        for each child c of n {<br>  if solve(c) succeeds, return true <br>}<br>return false
    </pre><br><br><br>
    <p>Eventually the recursion will "bottom" out at a leaf node. If the leaf node is a goal node, it is solvable; if the leaf node is not a goal <br>node, it is not solvable. This is our base case. In the above code, this is done by the lines</p><br><br><br>
    <pre style="color: #007eb4;">
        if n is a leaf node {<br>  if the leaf is a goal node, return true<br>  else return false <br>}
    </pre><br><br><br>
    <p>The backtracking algorithm is simple but important. You should understand it thoroughly. Another way of stating it is as follows:</p><br><br>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>To search a tree:</strong></li>
    </ul><br><br>
    <ol type="1">
        <br><br><li>If the tree consists of a single leaf, test whether it is a goal node.</li>
        <br><br><li>Otherwise, search the subtrees until you find one containing a goal node, or until you have searched them all unsuccessfully.</li>
    </ol><br><br><br><br>
    <h1>Non-recursive backtracking, using a stack</h1>
    <br><br><p>Backtracking is a rather typical recursive algorithm, and any recursive algorithm can be rewritten as a stack algorithm. In fact, <br>that is how your recursive algorithms are translated into machine or assembly language.</p><br><br>
    <pre style="color: #007eb4;">
        boolean solve(Node n) {<br> put node n on the stack;<br>  while the stack is not empty {<br>   if the node at the top of the stack is a leaf {<br>    if it is a goal node, return true <br>     else pop it off the stack <br>   }<br>    else { <br>      if the node at the top of the stack has untried children<br>        push the next untried child onto the stack <br>      else pop the node off the stack <br><br><br>   }<br>  return false <br>}
    </pre><br><br><br>
    <p>Starting from the root, the only nodes that can be pushed onto the stack are the children of the node currently on the top of the <br>stack, and these are only pushed on one child at a time; hence, the nodes on the stack at all times describe a valid path in the <br>tree. Nodes are removed from the stack only when it is known that they have no goal nodes among their descendents. Therefore,<br> if the root node gets removed (making the stack empty), there must have been no goal nodes at all, and no solution to the <br>problem.<br><br> When the stack algorithm terminates successfully, the nodes on the stack form (in reverse order) a path from the root to a goal<br>node. <br><br>Similarly, when the recursive algorithm finds a goal node, the path information is embodied (in reverse order) in the sequence of <br>recursive calls. Thus as the recursion unwinds, the path can be recovered one node at a time, by (for instance) printing the node <br>at the current level, or storing it in an array. <br><br>Here is the recursive backtracking algorithm, modified slightly to print (in reverse order) the nodes along the successful path:</p><br><br><br>
    <pre style="color: #007eb4;">
        boolean solve(Node n) {<br> if n is a leaf node {<br>  if the leaf is a goal node {<br>    print n<br>    return true<br>  }<br>    else return false<br> } else {<br>  for each child c of n {<br>    if solve(c) succeeds {<br>      print n<br>     return true<br>    }<br>  }<br>  return false<br> } <br>}
    </pre><br><br><br>
    <h1>Keep backtracking simple.</h1><br><br>
    <p>All of these versions of the backtracking algorithm are pretty simple, but when applied to a real problem, they can get pretty <br>cluttered up with details. Even determining whether the node is a leaf can be complex: <br><br>for example, if the path represents a series of moves in a chess endgame problem, the leaves are the checkmate and stalemate <br>solutions <br><br>To keep the program clean, therefore, tests like this should be buried in methods. In a chess game, for example, you could test <br>whether a node is a leaf by writing a gameOver method (or you could even call it isLeaf). This method would encapsulate all the <br>ugly details of figuring out whether any possible moves remain. <br><br>Notice that the backtracking altorithms require us to keep track, for each node on the current path, which of its children have <br>been tried already (so we don't have to try them again). In the above code we made this look simple, by just saying for each child <br><span style="font-weight: 700;">c of n.</span> In reality, it may be difficult to figure out what the possible children are, and there may be no obvious way to step through <br>them. In chess, for example, a node can represent one arrangement of pieces on a chessboard, and each child of that node can <br>represent the arrangement after some piece has made a legal move. How do you find these children, and how do you keep track <br>of which ones you've already examined? <br><br>The most straightforward way to keep track of which children of the node have been tried is as follows: Upon initial entry to the <br>node (that is, when you first get there from above), make a list of all its children. As you try each child, take it off the list. When <br>the list is empty, there are no remaining untried children, and you can return "failure." This is a simple approach, but it may require <br>quite a lot of additional work. <br><br>There is an easier way to keep track of which children have been tried, if you can define an <br>ordering on the children. If there is an ordering, and you know which child you just tried, you can determine which child to try next. <br><br>For example, you might be able to number the <span style="font-weight: 700;">childern</span> 1 through n, and try them in numerical order. Then, if you have just tried <br><span style="font-weight: 700;">child k,</span> you know that you have already tried children 1 through k-1, and you have not yet tried children k+1 through n. Or, if you <br>are trying to color a map with just four colors, you can always try red first, then yellow, then green, then blue. If child yellow fails, <br>you know to try child green next. If you are searching a maze, you can try choices in the order left, straight, right <span style="font-weight: 700;">(or perhaps north, east, south, west).</span><br><br>
         It isn't always easy to find a simple way to order the children of a node. In the chess game example, you might number your <br>pieces (or perphaps the squares of the board) and try them in numerical order; but in addition each piece may also have several <br>moves, and these must also be ordered.</p><br><br><br><br>
    <h1>Example: Tree Search</h1><br><br>
    <p>For starters, let's do the simplest possible example of backtracking, which is searching an actual tree. We will also use the <br>simplest kind of tree, a binary tree.<br><br>A binary tree is a data structure composed of nodes. One node is designated as the root node. Each node can reference (point <br>to) zero, one, or two other nodes, which are called its children. The children are referred to as the left child and/or the right child. <br>All nodes are reachable (by one or more steps) from the root node, and there are no cycles. For our purposes, although this is not <br>part of the definition of a binary tree, we will say that a node might or might not be a goal node, and will contain its name. The <br>first example in this paper (which we repeat here) shows a binary tree. <br><br>Here's a definition of the BinaryTree class:</p><br><br>
    <pre style="color: #007eb4;">public class BinaryTree { <br> BinaryTree leftChild = null;<br> BinaryTree rightChild = null;<br> boolean isGoalNode = false;<br> String name;<br><br> BinaryTree(String name, BinaryTree left, BinaryTree right, boolean isGoalNode) {<br>  this.name = name;<br>  leftChild = left;<br>  rightChild = right;<br>  this.isGoalNode = isGoalNode;<br> }<br>}</pre><br><br><br>
    <p>Next we will create a TreeSearch class, and in it we will define a method makeTree() which constructs the above binary tree.</p><br><br>
    <pre style="color: #007eb4;">static BinaryTree makeTree() {<br> BinaryTree root, a, b, c, d, e, f;<br> c = new BinaryTree("C", null, null, false);<br> d = new BinaryTree("D", null, null, false);<br> e = new BinaryTree("E", null, null, true);<br> f = new BinaryTree("F", null, null, false);<br> a = new BinaryTree("A", c, d, false);<br> b = new BinaryTree("B", e, f, false);<br> root = new BinaryTree("Root", a, b, false);<br> return root; <br>}</pre><br><br><br>
    <p>Here's a main program to create a binary tree and try to solve it:</p><br><br>
    <pre style="color: #007eb4;">public static void main(String args[]) {<br> BinaryTree tree = makeTree();<br> System.out.println(solvable(tree)); <br>}</pre><br><br>
    <p>And finally, here's the recursive backtracking routine to "solve" the binary tree by finding a goal node.</p><br><br>
    <pre style="color: #007eb4;">static boolean solvable(BinaryTree node) { <br>/* 1 */ if (node == null) return false; <br>/* 2 */ if (node.isGoalNode) return true; <br>/* 3 */ if (solvable(node.leftChild)) return true; <br>/* 4 */ if (solvable(node.rightChild)) return true; <br>/* 5 */ return false; <br>}</pre><br><br>
    <p>Here's what the numbered lines are doing:</p><br>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>If we are given a null node, it's not solvable. This statement is so that we can call this method with the children of a node, without <br>first checking whether those children actually exist.</li>
        <li>If the node we are given is a goal node, return success.</li>
        <li>See if the left child of node is solvable, and if so, conclude that node is solvable. We will only get to this line if node is non-null <br>and is not a goal node, says to</li>
        <li>Do the same thing for the right child.</li>
        <li>Since neither child of node is solvable, node itself is not solvable.</li>
    </ol><br><br><br>
    <p>This program runs correctly and produces the unenlightening result true.</p>
    <br><p>Each time we ask for another node, we have to check if it is null. In the above we put that check as the first thing in solvable. An <br>alternative would be to check first whether each child exists, and recur only if they do. Here's that alternative version:</p><br><br><br>
    <pre style="color: #007eb4;">static boolean solvable(BinaryTree node) {<br> if (node.isGoalNode) return true;<br> if (node.leftChild != null && solvable(node.leftChild)) return true;<br> if (node.rightChild != null && solvable(node.rightChild)) return true;<br> return false; <br>}</pre><br><br><br>
    <p>I think the first version is simpler, but the second version is slightly more efficient.</p><br><br><br>
    <h1>What are childern?</h1><br>
    <p>One of the things that simplifies the above binary tree search is that, at each choice point, you can ignore all the previous <br>choices. Previous choices don't give you any information about what you should do next; as far as you know, both the left and the <br>right child are possible solutions. In many problems, however, you may be able to eliminate children immediately, without <br>recursion. <br><br>Consider, for example, the problem of four-coloring a map. It is a theorem of mathematics that any map on a plane, no matter <br>how convoluted the countries are, can be colored with at most four colors, so that no two countries that share a border are the <br>same color. <br><br>To color a map, you choose a color for the first country, then a color for the second country, and so on, until all countries are <br>colored. <br><br>There are two ways to do this:</p><br><br>
    <ul>
        <li>Method 1. Try each of the four possible colors, and recur. When you run out of countries, check whether you are at a goal node.</li>
        <li>Method 2. Try only those colors that have not already been used for an adjacent country, and recur. If and when you run out of <br>countries, you have successfully colored the map.</li>
    </ul><br><br>
    <p>Let's apply each of these two methods to the problem of coloring a checkerboard. This should be easily solvable; after all, a <br>checkerboard only needs two colors.</p><br><br>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 700;">boolean mapIsOK()</span> <br>Used by method 1 to check (at a leaf node) whether the entire map is colored correctly. <br><br><span style="font-weight: 700;"> boolean okToColor(int row, int column, int color)</span> <br>Used by method 2 to check, at every node, whether there is an adjacent node already colored with the given color.<br><br> <span style="font-weight: 700;">[] nextRowAndColumn(int row, int column)</span> <br>Used by both methods to find the next "country" (actually, the row and column of the next square on the checkerboard).</p><br><br><br>
    <p>Here is the code for method 1:</p><br><br><br>
    <pre style="color: #007eb4;">boolean explore1(int row, int column, int color) {<br> if (row >= NUM_ROWS)return mapIsOK();<br> map[row][column] = color;<br> for (int nextColor = RED; nextColor <= BLUE; nextColor++) {<br>   int[] next = nextRowAndColumn(row, column);<br>   if (explore1(next[0], next[1], nextColor)) return true;<br> }<br> return false; <br>}</pre><br><br><br>
    <p>And here is the method 2:</p><br><br>
    <pre style="color: #007eb4;">
        boolean explore2(int row, int column, int color) {<br> if (row >= NUM_ROWS)return true;<br> if (okToColor(row, column, color)) {<br>   map[row][column] = color;<br>   for (int nextColor = RED; nextColor <= BLUE; nextColor++) {<br>    int[] next = nextRowAndColumn(row, column);<br>     if (explore2(next[0], next[1], nextColor)) return true; <br>   }<br> }<br> return false; <br>}
    </pre><br><br><br>
    <p>Those appear pretty similar, and you might think they are equally good. However, the timing information suggests otherwise:</p><br><br>
    <center>
        <table style="border: 500px;" border="1px"; color="black";>
        <tr>
            <td>  </td>
            <td style="background-color: rgb(163, 162, 162);"><b>2 by 3 map</b></td>
            <td style="background-color:  rgb(163, 162, 162);"><b>3 by 3 map</b></td>
            <td style="background-color:  rgb(163, 162, 162);"><b>3 by 4 map</b></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td style="background-color:  rgb(163, 162, 162);"><b>Method 1:</b></td>
            <td>60 ms</td>
            <td>940ms</td>
            <td>60530ms (1 minute)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td style="background-color:  rgb(163, 162, 162);"><b>Method 2: </b></td>
            <td>0 ms</td>
            <td>0 ms</td>
            <td>0 ms</td>
        </tr></table>
    </center>
    <p>The zeros in the above table indicate times too short to measure (less than 1 millisecond). Why this huge difference? Either of <br>these methods could have exponential growth. Eliminating a node automatically eliminates all of its descendents, and this will <br>often prevent exponential growth. Conversely, by waiting to check until a leaf node is reached, exponential growth is practically <br>guaranteed. If there is any way to eliminate children (reduce the set of choices), do so!</p><br><br><br><br>
    <h1>Debugging techniques</h1>
    <br><p>Often our first try at a program doesn't work, and we need to debug it. Debuggers are helpful, but sometimes we need to fall <br>back on inserting print statements. There are some simple tricks to making effective use of print statements. These tricks can be <br>applied to any program, but are especially useful when you are trying to debug recursive routines.</p><br><br>
    <h1>Trick #1: Indent when you print method entries and exits.</h1> <p>Often, the best debugging technique is to print every method call and return (or at least the most important ones). You probably <br>want to print, for each method, what parameters it came in with, and what value it leaves with. However, if you just print a long <br>list of these, it's hard to match up method exits with their corresponding entries. Indenting to show the level of nesting can help.</p><br><br><br>
    <h1>Trick #2: Use specialized print methods for debugging.</h1><p> Don't clutter up your actual code more than you must. Also, remember that code inserted for debugging purposes can itself <br>contain bugs, or (in the worst case) can affect the results, so be very careful with it.</p><br><br>
    <p>Here's our debugging code. For this trivial program, there's almost more debugging code than actual code, but in larger programs <br>the proportions will be better.</p><br><br>
    <pre style="color: #007eb4;">static String indent = "";<br><br><br>static String name(BinaryTree node) {<br>  if (node == null) return null;<br>   else return node.name; <br>}<br><br><br>static void enter(BinaryTree node) {<br>   System.out.println(indent + "Entering solvable(" + name(node) + ")");<br>   indent = indent + "| "; <br>}<br><br><br>static boolean yes(BinaryTree node) {<br>   indent = indent.substring(3);<br>   System.out.println(indent + "solvable(" + name(node) + ") <br>   returns true"); return true; <br>} <br><br><br>static boolean no(BinaryTree node) {<br>   indent = indent.substring(3);<br>   System.out.println(indent + "solvable(" + name(node) + ") returns false");<br>   return false; <br>}</pre><br.<br><br><br>
    <p>And we get the results:</p><br>
    <p>Entering solvable(Root)<br>| Entering solvable(A)<br>| | Entering solvable(C) <br>| | | Entering solvable(null) <br>| | | solvable(null) returns false <br>| | | Entering solvable(null) <br>| | | solvable(null) returns false <br>| | solvable(C) returns false <br>| | Entering solvable(D) <br>| | | Entering solvable(null) <br>| | | solvable(null) returns false <br>| | | Entering solvable(null) <br>| | | solvable(null) returns false <br>| | solvable(D) returns false <br>| solvable(A) returns false <br>| Entering solvable(B) <br>| | Entering solvable(E) <br>| | solvable(E) returns true <br>| solvable(B) returns true <br>solvable(Root) returns true <br>true</p><br><br><br>
    <h1>Trick #3: Never discard your debugging statements</h1><br><br>
    <p>Writing debugging statements is programming, too. Often it's as much work to debug the debugging statements as it is to debug <br>the actual program. Once your program is working, why throw this code away? <br><br>Obviously, you don't want to print out all this debugging information from a program you are ready to submit (or to turn over to <br>your manager). You could comment out your debugging calls, but that can be a lot of work. What's more, in the above example, <br>you would have to replace every return(yes(node)) with return(true), and every return(no(node)) with return false. With all these <br>changes, you might introduce new bugs into your program.<br><br>The simple solution is to make your debugging statements conditional. For example,</p><br><br><br>
    <pre style="color: #007eb4;">static final boolean debugging = false; <br><br>static void enter(BinaryTree node) {<br>  if (debugging) {<br>    System.out.println(indent + "Entering solvable(" + name(node) + ")");<br>    indent = indent + "| ";<br>  } <br>} <br><br>static boolean yes(BinaryTree node) {<br>  if (debugging) {<br>    indent = indent.substring(3);<br>    System.out.println(indent + "solvable(" + name(node) + ") returns true"); <br>  }<br>  return true; <br>}<br><br><br>static boolean no(BinaryTree node) {<br>  if (debugging) {<br>    indent = indent.substring(3);<br>    System.out.println(indent + "solvable(" + name(node) + ") returns false");<br>  }<br>  return false; <br>}</pre><br><br><br>
    <p>In industry, actual programs often have multiple flags to control different aspects of debugging. Don't worry too much about <br>making your code larger; modern compilers will notice that since the variable debugging is final, it can never be true, and the <br>controlled code will be discarded.</p><br><br>
    <h1>Trick #4: Create an exception</h1><br><br>
    <p>If an Exception is thrown, you can get information about just where it happened by sending it the message <br>printStackTrace(PrintStream). Since an Exception is an object like any other, you can create and throw your own Exceptions. <br>However, Java programmers don't always realize that you can create an Exception without throwing it. For example, the following <br>code</p><br><br>
    <p>will print out a message something like this, and the program will then continue normally. That is, the above code just acts like a <br>print statement.</p><br><br><br>
    <pre style="color: #007eb4;">java.lang.Exception: Checkpoint Charlie<br>  at TreeSearch.solvable(TreeSearch.java:53)<br>  at TreeSearch.solvable(TreeSearch.java:57)<br>  at TreeSearch.main(TreeSearch.java:72)<br>  at __SHELL38.run(__SHELL38.java:16)<br>  at bluej.runtime.ExecServer.suspendExecution(Unknown Source)</pre><br><br><br>
    <h1>Example: Cindy's puzzle</h1><br><br>

    <p>The goal is to reverse the positions of the marbles:</p><br>
    <center><table border="1" style="background-color: lightgray; margin: auto;" ><tr>

    </td></table></center><br>
    <p>The black marbles can only move to the right, and the white marbles can only move to the left (no backing up). At each move, a <br>marble can either:</p><br><br>
    <ul>
        <li>Move one space ahead, if that space is clear, or</li>
        <li>Jump ahead over exactly one marble of the opposite color, if the space just beyond that marble is clear.</li>
    </ul><br><br>
    <p>For example, you could make the following sequence of moves:</p><br><br>

    <p>The backtracking method is named solvable and returns a boolean. In solvable we shall need to check whether we are at a leaf, <br>which in this case means a position from which no further moves are possible. This isn't so easy. <br><br>Now to the program. The main program will initialize the board, and call a recursive backtracking routine to attempt to solve the <br>puzzle. The backtracking routine will either succeed and print out a winning path, or it will fail, and the main program will have to <br>print out the bad news. <br><br>The backtracking method is named solvable and returns a boolean. In solvable we shall need to check whether we are at a leaf, <br>which in this case means a position from which no further moves are possible. This isn't so easy. <br><br>Each possible move will result in a new board position, and these new board positions are the children of the current board <br>position. Hence to find the children of a node (that is, of a board position), we need only find the possible moves from that node. <br>Remember that it is also highly desirable to find an ordering on these possible moves. <br><br>Here it is time to stop and take thought. To make progress, we must analyze the game to some extent. Probably a number of <br>approaches would work, and what follows is based on the way I worked it out. If you were to program this puzzle, you might find <br>a different but equally valid approach. <bR><br>First, notice that if a marble has a move, that move is unique: if it can move ahead one square, then it cannot jump. If it can jump, <br>it cannot move ahead one square. This suggests that, to find the possible moves, we might assign numbers to the marbles, and <br>check each marble in turn. When we have looked at all the marbles, we have looked at all the possible moves. This would require <br>having a table to keep track of where each marble is, or else somehow "marking" each marble with its number and searching the <br>board each time to find the marble we want. Neither alternative is very attractive. <br><br>Next, notice that for a given board position, each marble occupies a unique space. Hence, instead of talking about moving a <br>particular marble, we can talk about moving the marble in a particular space. If a move is possible from a given space, then that <br>must be the only move possible from that space, because if the marble in that space has a move, it is unique. There is a slight <br>complication because not every space contains a marble, but at least the spaces (unlike the marbles) stay in one place.</p><br><br><br>
    <p style="font-weight: 500;">Now we have a simpler ordering of moves to use in our program. Just check, in order, the 2n+1 spaces of the board. For each <br>space, either zero or one moves is possible. With this understanding, we can write a boolean method canMove(int[] board, int <br>position) which determines whether a move is possible from the given position:</p><br><br>
    <ul>
        <li>If the position is empty, no move is possible;</li>
        <li>If the position contains a black marble, the method checks for a move or jump to the right;</li>
        <li>If the position contains a white marble, the method checks for a move or jump to the left.</li>
    </ul><br><br>
    <p>We write another method <span style="font-weight: 700;">int[] makeMove(int[] oldBoard, int position)</span> that will take a board and a position, make a move from <br>that position, and return as its value a new board. (We could write this somewhat more efficiently by changing the old board, <br>rather than creating a new one, but here we are more concerned with simplicity.) In technical jargon, makeMove is "applicative" <br>rather than "mutative." <br><br>Along with <span>canMove and makeMove,</span> we are using methods <span>puzzleSolved and printBoard</span> with meanings that <br>should be obvious.</p><br><br><br>
    <pre style="color: #007eb4;">boolean solvable(int[] board) {<br>  if (puzzleSolved(board)) {<br>    return true;<br>  }<br>  for (int position = 0; position < BOARD_SIZE; position++) {<br>    if (canMove(board, position)) {<br>      int[] newBoard = makeMove(board, position);<br>      if (solvable(newBoard)) {<br>        printBoard(newBoard); <br>       return true;<br>     }<br>   }<br>  }<br>  return false;<br> }</pre><br><br>
    <p>Along with canMove and makeMove, we are using methods puzzleSolved and printBoard with meanings that should be obvious.<br><br> Here is some output from the program:</p><br><br>
    <ol type="1" reversed style="color: darkblue;">
        <li><b style="color: black;">WHITE WHITE WHITE _____ BLACK BLACK BLACK</b></li>
        <li><b style="color: black;">WHITE WHITE WHITE BLACK _____ BLACK BLACK</b></li>
        <li><b style="color: black;">WHITE WHITE _____ BLACK WHITE BLACK BLACK</b></li>
        <li><b style="color: black;">WHITE _____ WHITE BLACK WHITE BLACK BLACK</b></li>
        <li><b style="color: black;">WHITE BLACK WHITE _____ WHITE BLACK BLACK</b></li>
        <li><b style="color: black;">WHITE BLACK WHITE BLACK WHITE _____ BLACK</b></li>
        <li><b style="color: black;">WHITE BLACK WHITE BLACK WHITE BLACK _____</b></li>
        <li><b style="color: black;">WHITE BLACK WHITE BLACK _____ WHITE BLACK</b></li>
        <li><b style="color: black;">WHITE BLACK _____ WHITE BLACK BLACK BLACK</b></li>
        <li><b style="color: black;">_____ BLACK WHITE BLACK WHITE BLACK WHITE</b></li>
        <li><b style="color: black;">BLACK _____ WHITE BLACK WHITE BLACK WHITE</b></li>
        <li><b style="color: black;">BLACK BLACK WHITE _____ WHITE BLACK WHITE</b></li>
        <li><b style="color: black;">BLACK BLACK WHITE BLACK WHITE _____ BLACK</b></li>
        <li><b style="color: black;">BLACK BLACK WHITE BLACK _____ BLACK BLACK</b></li>
        <li><b style="color: black;">BLACK BLACK _____ BLACK WHITE BLACK WHITE</b></li>
        <li><b style="color: black;">BLACK BLACK BLACK _____ WHITE WHITE WHITE</b></li>
    </ol>
    <P style="background-color: lightgray; height: 117px; width: 1007px;">Notice that the solution is given in reverse order: BLACK starts out on the left and WHITE on the right, as in the last <br>line. I've added line numbers to the actual output in order to emphasize this point. Backtracking always produces its <br>results (sequence of choices) in reverse order; it is up to you, the programmer, to reverse the results again to get <br>them in the correct order.</P>
